# Birthday Notifier

Birthday Notifer is a mobile android application that syncs with your phone contacts and alerts you when it's your friends birthday. 

The idea for this app came about when I got rid of most of my social media; I didn't remember most of my friends birthdays, and I wasn't getting notified when it WAS their birthday.
